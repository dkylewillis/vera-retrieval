# Changelog

Notable changes to VERA software, CLI, and Python APIs.

**0.3.x versions the packages, CLI, and desktop app.** The `.vera` archive
format remains **0.2**. Existing archives are compatible; you do not need to
reconvert files created with 0.2 tooling in order to search or inspect them.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The PDF toolbar no longer shows a Passage/Figure color legend next to
  Download, and the extra ⋮ overflow menu is gone. First/last page remain on
  Home/End and the thumbnail rail.

- The desktop PDF viewer uses Mozilla-style dark chrome (the same PDF.js look
  as ChatGPT's viewer): a hamburger-toggled page thumbnail rail, compact page
  and zoom chips, a page-fit control, group dividers, and download / print.
  Citation and figure highlight overlays are unchanged.
  Rotate counterclockwise turns the page and those overlays together.

- The CLI is published on PyPI as [`vera`](https://pypi.org/project/vera/).
  Install with `pip install vera` (extras `vera[mcp]` and `vera[docling]`).
  `pip install vera-cli` remains a compatibility alias that depends on `vera`.
  The Python import is still `vera_cli`.

### Fixed

- Desktop PDF **Fit page** sizes against the canvas client box and fits the
  page that occupies the most of the well, then pads the canvas so that page
  is centered below the viewer header and PDF toolbar.

- `vera get` / MCP `vera_get_chunk` JSON locators (`ok`, `file`, `path`) are
  applied after chunk metadata so caller tags cannot spoof a failed get or
  attribute a chunk to another archive. Convert `--metadata` now rejects
  `file`, `path`, `ok`, and `error`. Existing archives that already stored
  those keys still return the opened archive path.

### Added

- Desktop Ask answers render LaTeX with KaTeX (`$…$`, `$$…$$`, `\(`…`\)`,
  `\[`…`\]`) alongside GitHub-flavored Markdown, including while the
  response is still streaming.

- Convert `--metadata KEY=VALUE` stamps caller tags onto archive metadata and
  every chunk. Search `--where KEY=VALUE` filters stored metadata before
  `top_k` (AND across keys; comma-separated values are IN). Directory search
  and `vera index build` accept `--include PATTERN`. Chunk-only `where` keys
  that are not in the collection index fall back to per-file search with
  `index.used=false` and `chunk metadata filter not in collection index`.
  MCP `vera_search` / `vera_corpus_search` take the same `where` / `includes`
  arguments.

- `vera get FILE CHUNK_ID` fetches one stored chunk by id as citation-ready
  JSON (`ok`, locator fields, `chunk_id`, `text`, and the same citation keys
  as a search hit, without `score`). `--figures` and `--regions` match search
  enrichment. An unknown or whitespace-only id exits 1 with
  `{"ok": false, "error": "chunk not found: ..."}`. MCP `vera_get_chunk` returns
  the same object. Shared `vera_ingest.viewer.chunk_payload()` flattens a
  `ChunkRecord`; `result_payload()` layers retrieval scores on top.

- Markdown ingest: `vera convert notes.md` (and directory discovery of `.md` /
  `.markdown`) uses a bundled `markdown` pipeline in `vera-ingest`. Convert
  selects a pipeline from the file extension when `--parser` is omitted.
  Explicit `--parser pymupdf` on a Markdown file fails instead of silently
  switching. Search citations use heading paths and `text_span` locators;
  the original Markdown is stored for export and desktop preview. Explorer,
  Convert, and Reconvert treat PDFs and Markdown as convertible sources.

- Docling search-only ingest of DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and HTML (plus `.htm`) when
  `vera-ingest-docling` is installed. Omit `--parser` to select Docling for
  those extensions; PDFs still default to PyMuPDF. Office/HTML conversion skips
  PDF layout models, RapidOCR, and `pypdfium2` page recovery. Search works;
  PDF-style highlight overlays are not produced for these types.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- `vera figures FILE` lists stored figure metadata (captions, pages, bboxes,
  `asset_id`) and, with `--out-dir`, writes `{asset_id}.{ext}` image files and
  adds `path` to JSON. Missing or non-figure `--asset-id` values exit 1 with
  `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`.
- MCP `vera_get_figure(file, asset_id)` returns native image content plus
  citation metadata. `vera_figures` and `vera_search(include_figures=...)`
  stay metadata-only.
- `vera_ingest.export_figures()` writes figure attachments under a directory
  with the same path-safety rules as `export_source_document()`.
- Official `vera-embed-openai` plugin: stdlib HTTPS client for
  `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and
  `text-embedding-ada-002`. `vera-cli` and `vera-app` depend on it the same
  way they depend on PyMuPDF; the frozen sidecar registers it via
  `ensure_registered()`. See [docs/packages/vera-embed-openai.md](docs/packages/vera-embed-openai.md).
- Desktop **Settings → Embeddings** stores `OPENAI_API_KEY` through the
  existing encrypted env-secret IPC. Convert presets include the two
  `text-embedding-3-*` models; hashing remains the default.
- Archives converted with a hosted embedder are not portable for semantic
  search: the recipient needs their own `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Keyword search
  still works.

### Changed

- `vera-mcp` depends on `mcp>=1.0,<2`. MCP Python SDK 2.x removed
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`; a fresh unbounded install could not start `vera mcp`.
  Install `vera-cli[mcp]`, not a bare `mcp` 2.x package.

- Packaged MiniLM uses ONNX Runtime instead of PyTorch / Sentence Transformers.
  Archive identity stays `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. The installer
  vendors a VERA-exported fp32 graph (SHA256-pinned via `export_minilm_onnx.py`
  and `compare_minilm_onnx.py`). `app:dev` vendors the ONNX
  snapshot before launch. Sidecar
  freeze `--exclude-module`s Torch / Sentence Transformers even when the
  project venv has the `ml` extra; MiniLM export in release CI uses a throwaway
  venv.

- MiniLM selects its runtime by what is actually available: ONNX Runtime when a
  VERA-exported graph is present, Sentence Transformers otherwise. Installing
  the `onnx` extra no longer makes MiniLM fail when no graph is vendored, so
  `pip install "vera-doc[ml]"` is enough for MiniLM on the CLI and a checkout
  synced with `--extra onnx --extra ml` works without
  `VERA_ONNX_MINILM_HOME`. The packaged app and `app:dev` are unaffected —
  both vendor a graph and still never load Sentence Transformers.

### Fixed

- `vera convert --json` and `vera search --json` report OpenAI embedder
  failures (missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`, HTTP errors) as
  `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` instead of an uncaught traceback.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08

### Added

- Pluggable ingest pipelines through the `vera.ingest_pipelines` entry-point
  group and `register_ingest_pipeline()`. Select a pipeline with
  `vera convert --parser provider[:variant]` or `convert(..., parser=...)`.
- Provider-owned ingest settings via repeatable
  `vera convert --pipeline-option KEY=VALUE` and `pipeline_options=` on
  `IngestRequest`. Legacy flags (`--chunk-size`, `--overlap`, `--ocr`,
  `--ocr-language`, `--ocr-dpi`) remain compatibility aliases; descriptor
  fields and OCR engine control which aliases are forwarded. Tesseract
  `--ocr-language` (`eng`) is not forwarded to Docling/RapidOCR, which
  keeps its own default `en`.
- Pipeline descriptors for discovery and schema-driven UI:
  `describe_ingest_pipelines`, typed pipeline options, and the desktop
  Convert view's `PipelineConfigForm` / **Advanced pipeline options**.
- Official Docling converter (`vera-ingest-docling`) registering
  `docling` / `docling:hybrid`, with HybridChunker, RapidOCR, first-run
  model-download notes, and `pdf_backend` recovery on page-level memory
  errors (per-page retry, whole-document `pypdfium2`, then page-batch
  `pypdfium2`). RapidOCR uses the ONNX weights shipped with `docling[rapidocr]`
  even when `DOCLING_ARTIFACTS_PATH` only holds layout models. Install it with
  `vera-cli[docling]` or `uv sync --extra docling`. The 0.3.0 desktop app does
  not list or freeze this pipeline (Convert is PyMuPDF-only).
- Pluggable embedding providers through the `vera.embedders` entry-point
  group and `register_embedder()`. Model specs use `provider:model-id`
  (existing aliases still work).
- Provider-owned embedder settings via `--embedder-option KEY=VALUE` /
  `embedder_options=`, advertised through `EmbedderOptions` metadata and
  `describe_embedding_providers`.
- Embedder capability helpers: `vera.embedder_models` /
  `list_embedding_models`, `preflight_embedder`, and
  `capabilities.credential_env` (secrets stay in environment variables, not
  Options).
- Desktop Convert view: persist the selected embedding model separately from
  Chat; show installed provider suggestions; hashing and MiniLM presets.
- Packaged desktop app: one frozen sidecar with PyMuPDF, hashing, and
  Sentence Transformers. MiniLM (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) weights ship in the
  installer, so Local semantic conversion does not download those files on
  first use. Docling is not part of the 0.3.0 installer or Convert view;
  use `vera-cli[docling]` for that pipeline. There is no Settings → Python
  plugins page and no `vera_plugin_host`. Convert drives `EmbedderConfigForm`
  from descriptors, persists `embedder_configs`, and gates conversion on
  `preflight_embedder`. Search reports `skipped_semantic_model_groups` when a
  query embedder is unavailable. Hosted embedding providers were not part of
  0.3.0; OpenAI now ships as `vera-embed-openai` (see 0.3.1).
- Desktop convert timing log: sidecar stderr (including `elapsed_ms` convert
  steps) is teed to `userData/logs/sidecar.log` in both `app:dev`
  and packaged VERA. **File > Open convert log...**, Convert **Open log**, and
  **Settings → Diagnostics** open it. CLI `vera convert` still prints the same
  timing on stderr only.

- Typed `Citation` on search hits (`result.citation`) plus configurable hybrid
  `semantic_weight` / `keyword_weight` on `VeraDocument.search()`.
- Shared `vera_ingest.viewer.result_payload()` serializer for CLI, MCP, and
  desktop search JSON.
- Vectorized semantic scoring, batched attachment loads, and FTS writes that
  align `chunks_fts.rowid` with `chunks.rowid` (format 0.2 compatible; legacy
  archives fall back to deleting by `chunk_id` and to appending when another
  chunk already occupies the matching FTS rowid).
- `VeraDocument.iter_raw_chunks()` / `format_metadata()` for library indexing
  without private `VeraDocument` access.
- `vera ocr-languages list` and `vera ocr-languages download` for Tesseract
  language data used by the PyMuPDF pipeline (English is bundled; other
  languages are fetched into a local cache).
- `vera-lab` contributor layout lab (workspace `dev` extra only; not
  published to PyPI).

### Changed

- `EmbedderOptions` and `PipelineOptions` `from_mapping` reject integers
  outside advertised `minimum`/`maximum` (hashing `dimension` 8–4096,
  pipeline `chunk_size` 100–3000).
- Conversion writes a validated temporary sibling and publishes atomically.
  Empty (no searchable chunks) conversions fail with an OCR-oriented message.
  `vera convert --json` prints `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` for those
  failures, a missing input path (exit 1), and an unknown `--parser` /
  `--model` (exit 2) instead of leaving stdout empty.
- Batch conversion skips an existing `.vera` only when it validates and its
  stored `source_file_hash` matches the current PDF, and reports malformed
  archives separately (`malformed_existing`).
- Default PDF pipeline lives in `vera-ingest-pymupdf` (PyMuPDF + pdfplumber +
  selective Tesseract OCR). `vera-ingest` is the provider-neutral registry
  and archive writer.
- PyMuPDF chunk size and overlap labels count whitespace-split words, not
  characters or LLM subword tokens. Docling `chunk_size` uses the same
  whitespace counting (advertised as tokens).

### Breaking

- The `vera-doc` distribution now imports as `vera_doc` (`from vera_doc import VeraDocument`). The previous `import vera` name collided with an unrelated PyPI package. There is no compatibility shim.
- Unknown embedding model / provider names raise an error
  (`UnknownEmbeddingModelError`) instead of silently creating mislabeled
  hashing vectors. The archive records the model that must embed queries at
  search time, so a silent substitute would search against the wrong space.
- Unknown ingest pipeline / `--parser` names raise an error instead of
  falling back to PyMuPDF.
- There is no silent fallback to a different embedding model or ingest
  pipeline when a named provider is missing or fails to load.

### Fixed

- `vera mcp` prints an install hint and exits 2 when the optional `mcp`
  extra is not installed, instead of raising `ImportError`.
- Desktop Convert no longer hangs on the first MiniLM load. The sidecar
  imports Torch on the main thread before it reads stdin. On Windows,
  importing `sentence_transformers` from a convert worker while
  `stdin.readline()` is blocked deadlocks until Stop writes a JSON line.
- PyMuPDF conversion imports `pymupdf` directly, so `vera convert` no longer
  prints a deprecated `fitz` API warning on every run.
- Docling CLI conversion prefetches only Heron ONNX and TableFormer
  accurate (~380 MB) instead of both Heron engines plus TableFormer fast
  (~700 MB), and convert uses the ONNX layout engine.
- Docling `docling_parse/pdf_resources` (fonts/cmaps) must sit next to the
  native parser. Without that tree, convert logged
  `resources-dir does not exist` and rejected the PDF in ~20 ms. Whole-document
  `pypdfium2` fallback now also covers a `FAILURE` status from that backend.
- Docling page-level and page-batch `pypdfium2` recovery no longer fails with
  `multiple values for keyword argument 'page_range'` when retrying a failed
  page.

### Desktop

- File → Open Folder adds the chosen directory to Explorer as a library
  folder (same path as the sidebar Open Folder action).
- Reconvert skips exporting a source PDF when inspect fails and no embedded
  original is present; pipeline and OCR options prefill from inspect.
- Explorer type filters prune files hidden by the filter from the current
  selection.
- Explorer restores the last active library and collapsed inactive folders as
  soon as folders appear, instead of expanding every tree until other folders'
  index-status checks finish.
- Explorer checkboxes set row membership from the native change event so
  unchecking a file cannot leave a stale checkmark while Chat still shows one
  selected document.
- Removed unused `saveVera` / `defaultVeraPath` helpers.
- Shared IPC channel, sidecar action, and stream event names, with a contract
  test that TypeScript `StreamEvent` names match sidecar emissions.
- Split the renderer shell into `AppShell`, `ExplorerSidebar`, `ChatsSidebar`,
  `CenterChatView`, and `CenterSearchView`.
- `npm run app:dev` runs through `scripts/app-dev.js`, which picks `npm.cmd`
  on Windows and `npm` elsewhere before handing off to `uv run`, since `uv`
  does not resolve Windows shims on its own
  ([astral-sh/uv#8770](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8770)). It
  installs the `app` and `ml` extras so source-run Convert matches the
  packaged sidecar (PyMuPDF + hashing + MiniLM). Docling remains a CLI extra.
- Fixed a blank-window crash on every launch: the sandboxed preload script's
  restricted `require` cannot load `protocol.ts`'s compiled ES module output
  (or a sibling JSON/CommonJS file by relative path), so `IPC_CHANNELS` threw
  before `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` ran and the unhandled renderer
  error left `window.vera` undefined. `preload.cts` now duplicates the
  channel map inline, guarded by a contract test against drift.

### Senior-review fixes

- Index and directory fan-out share one RRF ranking path.
- Search hydrates only the top-k hit chunks, not the full chunk table.
- Sidecar search runs in the background so cancel can land; one cancel primitive.
- Explorer reports when the folder-walk depth cap is hit.
- Auto OCR no longer skips scans whose only native text is headers/boilerplate.
- OCR language codes are sanitized before they become tessdata paths.
- Docling maps real ErrorItem page numbers and recovers when the error has no page list.
- Dotted `KEY=VALUE` tokens stay strings (no float coercion).
- Export writes to the stored basename only.
- MCP search default `top_k` is 10, matching the CLI.
- Ignore sidecar results after a newer call for the same scope.
- `convert()` omitted aliases (`None`) mean pipeline defaults.
- Clamp chunk overlap below `chunk_size` so carry never overruns.
- Consume the skip flag; do not leak it into pipeline options.

Voyage and Ollama embeddings remain pending (they need a query-versus-document
hint). OpenAI ships as `vera-embed-openai`. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
