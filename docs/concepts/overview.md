# Concepts

This page explains the core ideas behind VERA at a level useful for working with
the public Python API and CLI.

## `.vera` archives

A `.vera` file is a single SQLite database containing:

- **Chunks** — searchable text segments with JSON metadata (page numbers,
  heading paths, layout regions, and caller-defined fields).
- **Embeddings** — pre-computed vectors for semantic search, stored alongside
  the chunk they represent.
- **Keyword index** — an FTS5 full-text index for exact-term and phrase
  matching.
- **Attachments** — optional opaque bytes (original PDFs, figure images,
  viewer payloads) linked to chunks by reference.

Archives are validated at creation time and can be inspected or re-validated at
any point with `vera inspect` / `vera validate` or the Python equivalents.

## Chunks and records

Applications that already have final text use **`ChunkRecord`** objects. VERA
does not parse or chunk source files inside `vera-doc`; that work lives in
`vera-ingest`.

Each record has:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Stable identifier within the archive |
| `text` | Searchable content |
| `metadata` | JSON-compatible citation and filter fields |
| `vector` | Optional pre-computed embedding (embedded automatically when omitted) |
| `attachments` | Optional links to stored binary attachments |

## Search modes

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| `hybrid` | General questions and regulatory prose (default) |
| `keyword` | Section numbers, IDs, and exact phrases |
| `semantic` | Paraphrased natural-language questions |

Hybrid search fuses semantic and keyword rankings. Results include relevance
scores plus citation metadata — use the metadata as evidence, not the score
alone.

## Read vs write access

**`VeraDocument`** is the storage and search API. Open archives in read-only
mode (the default) for search and inspection; use write mode for mutations.
Extractor-produced figures, page text, highlight regions, and source export
are interpreted by `vera_ingest.viewer`, not by `vera-doc`.

## Document libraries

Searching many `.vera` files in a folder uses **`VeraCorpus`**. For large
libraries, build a persistent **library index** (`.vera-index/`) with
`build_library_index()` or `vera index build`. The index is derived and
rebuildable; the `.vera` files remain the source of truth.

## Package responsibilities

```text
vera-doc              Storage, search, corpus, library indexes
vera-ingest           Registry, convert orchestration, shared types
vera-ingest-pymupdf   Default PDF parsing / OCR pipeline
vera-embed-openai     Official OpenAI embeddings plugin
vera                  Command-line interface (vera convert, search, index, …)
vera-mcp              Model Context Protocol server for AI agents
vera-app              Desktop app Python sidecar (Electron)
```

Conversion composes `vera-ingest` (+ a pipeline plugin) with `vera-doc`.
Search and indexing use `vera-doc` directly.
