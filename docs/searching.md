# Search documents

VERA supports semantic, keyword, and hybrid search over the content already
stored in an archive. Search is local and does not require a retrieval server.

## Basic search

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "stormwater detention requirements"
```

The default mode is `hybrid` and the default result limit is 10:

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "stormwater detention requirements" --mode hybrid --top-k 10
```

Use `--json` for scripts and agents:

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "stormwater detention requirements" --top-k 5 --json
```

## Choose a search mode

### Hybrid

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "when must runoff be detained?" --mode hybrid
```

Hybrid combines min-max-normalized semantic and keyword rankings with equal
weights by default. The Python API can change the blend:

```python
results = document.search(
    "when must runoff be detained?",
    mode="hybrid",
    semantic_weight=0.7,
    keyword_weight=0.3,
)
print(results[0].citation.page_start, results[0].citation.heading_path)
```

Use hybrid for most questions, especially when both concepts and document
terminology matter.

### Keyword

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "\"Section 4.2\"" --mode keyword
```

Keyword search uses SQLite FTS5. Use it for exact phrases, section numbers,
identifiers, table labels, and known terminology.

If an FTS query cannot be used directly or has no hits, VERA can fall back to a
broader token-prefix query. Punctuation may be removed during that fallback.
For short or hyphenated identifiers, confirm that the literal identifier
appears in the returned text.

### Semantic

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "how does the site reduce peak flow?" --mode semantic
```

Semantic search compares the query embedding with stored chunk embeddings. Use
it when the wording is likely to differ from the document.

## Interpret results

Every result contains:

- `chunk_id`
- `score`
- `text`
- `page_start` and `page_end`
- `heading_path`
- `source_filename`
- `document_id`

In Python these citation fields also appear on `result.citation`. CLI, MCP, and
desktop JSON flatten the same keys onto the result object — there is no nested
`citation` field in those payloads.

Scores rank results within a search. They are not probabilities or confidence
values, and scores from different queries or modes should not be compared as
though they share one scale. Desktop Ask additionally drops weak hits with a
relative `quality` cutoff against the top score; CLI, MCP, and the Search view
return the unfiltered ranked list.

Treat the text and its location as evidence. A citation should include the
source filename, page or page range, and heading when available:

```text
(manual.pdf, p. 117, Chapter 4 > Detention Design)
```

## Filter before top_k

Scope a search with stored metadata rather than by dropping hits from JSON.
`--where` is applied before `top_k`, so rank and result counts stay honest.

```bash
vera search "./library" "adding capacity" --where company=GRID --json
vera search "./library" "adding capacity" --where company=GRID,PWRX --json
vera search "./library" "adding capacity" \
  --where company=GRID --where document_type=filings --json
```

Distinct `--where` keys are AND. Comma-separated values for one key are IN.
Repeated flags for the same key union the IN set. Values coerce like
`--pipeline-option` (digit-only integers, boolean words, otherwise strings;
dotted tokens such as `3.10` stay strings). A missing key fails the predicate.
List-valued *stored* metadata is not an IN clause. Stamp those
keys at convert time:

```bash
vera convert filing.md archives/src_aaa.vera --metadata company=GRID --json
```

`--include` and `--exclude` choose files by relative path (discovery), not
metadata. `--include` on a single-file search exits 2. Desktop Search and Ask
do not expose `--where`; use the CLI or MCP. Indexed directory search can
apply a `--where` key only when it is a citation column or present on every
indexed archive; otherwise the search falls back to per-file filtering so
chunk-only tags on sibling files are not dropped.

To reload one stored chunk by id — for example to verify that a quoted span is
still in the chunk body — use `vera get FILE CHUNK_ID --json` (MCP:
`vera_get_chunk`). Searching again is not a substitute: rank can change, and
keyword search can miss a short quote. `get` returns the same citation fields
as a search hit, without `score`.

## Include neighboring chunks

A result may begin after a definition or end before an exception. Include
neighboring chunks:

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "detention requirements" --context-chunks 1 --json
```

Each result gains `before_chunks` and `after_chunks`. These chunks are ordered
in document sequence and carry their own citation fields.

## Find figures and page regions

Add figure metadata:

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "pipe sizing chart" --figures --json
```

Add source block bounding boxes:

```bash
vera search "manual.vera" "detention requirements" --regions --json
```

See [Figures and highlight regions](figures-and-regions.md) for the coordinate
contract and limitations.

## Improve a weak search

If results are too broad:

- add the governing action: `requirements`, `definition`, `exceptions`;
- add a section, district, facility type, or threshold;
- switch to keyword mode for exact language.

If results are sparse:

- remove one constraint;
- use a likely synonym;
- search the parent concept;
- switch to semantic mode;
- increase `--top-k`.

Split compound questions into separate searches. For comprehensive research,
use several targeted queries and synthesize only claims supported by the
retrieved text.

## Empty and failed searches

An empty successful search returns `results: []` and exits 0. It means no
candidate was returned for that query and mode; it does not prove the concept
is absent from the document.

Missing paths, unreadable archives, unavailable embedding dependencies, and
directories with no archives generally exit nonzero and write an error to
stderr. Check the process exit code before parsing JSON.

For a directory containing both healthy and malformed archives, search
continues across the healthy subset and returns exit 0. Inspect the top-level
`skipped_files` array for excluded paths and validation reasons. A directory
with no discoverable archives is still an error.

## Search a library

Pass a directory instead of a file to search multiple archives as one corpus:

```bash
vera search "./library" "termination clause" --json
```

See [Document libraries](document-libraries.md) for recursive discovery,
exclusions, collection indexes, stale-index fallback, and mixed embedding
models.
