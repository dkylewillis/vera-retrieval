# vera-mcp

`vera-mcp` publishes the `vera_mcp` Python package and `vera-mcp` entry point.
It depends on `vera-doc` for storage/search and `vera-ingest` for viewer helpers
(pages, figures, regions, source export). It exposes archive and corpus
retrieval as Model Context Protocol tools.

The package is a protocol adapter. Ranking, validation, and conversion remain
implemented by `vera-doc` and `vera-ingest`.

## Install

From PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install "vera[mcp]>=0.3.0"
```

Or install the package directly:

```bash
python -m pip install "vera-mcp>=0.3.0"
```

From a repository checkout:

```bash
uv run --extra mcp vera mcp
```

The server communicates over stdio. Do not add `--json` or write unrelated
output to stdout.

- [MCP tools](../mcp.md#tools) — search, corpus search, inspect, validate,
  figures, figure image fetch, pages, chunk fetch, and regions.

## API reference

- [`vera_mcp`](../reference/vera-mcp.md) — `build_server()` and the stdio entry point.

MCP intentionally does not expose conversion, index mutation, source export, or
retrieval evaluation. Use `vera` or the Python packages for those tasks.
