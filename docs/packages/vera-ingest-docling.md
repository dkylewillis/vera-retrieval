# vera-ingest-docling

Optional Docling ingest pipeline plugin for VERA. Install it beside `vera-ingest`
to register the `docling` provider under the `vera.ingest_pipelines` entry-point
group.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install "vera-ingest-docling>=0.3.0"
```

From a repository checkout, `uv sync --extra docling` adds it to the
workspace `.venv` (CLI and tests). It is not bundled in the installer.
Non-desktop users can also:

```bash
pip install "vera-cli[docling]>=0.3.0"
```

The 0.3.0 Windows app does not freeze this pipeline or list **Advanced layout
(slower)** in Convert. CLI MiniLM embeddings use `vera-doc[onnx]` /
`uv sync --extra onnx` plus a VERA-exported snapshot (or the installer graph).
Other Sentence Transformers models still need `vera-doc[ml]` /
`uv sync --extra ml`. Those extras are independent of this Docling package.

The package pins Docling to the current supported minor range with the
`rapidocr` extra (RapidOCR + `onnxruntime`) and pulls a larger machine-learning
stack (including Torch). Do not add it to base VERA installs unless you need
layout-aware Docling conversion. Descriptor discovery does not import Docling;
if `docling` or `docling_core` is missing, Convert lists the pipeline as not
installed instead of failing plugin load.

## First-run models

Docling may download layout and table model artifacts on first conversion.
RapidOCR weights ship with `docling[rapidocr]` (and the desktop sidecar freeze);
VERA pins those packaged ONNX paths so setting `DOCLING_ARTIFACTS_PATH` does not
require a separate RapidOCR prefetch. VERA treats that artifacts directory as
offline only when both `docling-project--docling-layout-heron-onnx` (with
weights) and `docling-project--docling-models` (TableFormer `tm_config.json`)
are complete. A half-written folder stays online so Hugging Face can resume.
Prefetch those models before the first CLI convert, or set
`DOCLING_ARTIFACTS_PATH` and let Hugging Face resume. Stopping
mid-download does not abort Hugging Face immediately; the next run resumes.
The first prefetch is about 380 MB (Heron ONNX + TableFormer accurate). Convert
uses the ONNX layout engine so the Transformers Heron snapshot is not required.
For other Docling models in offline
or CI environments:

1. Prefetch models while network access is available.
2. Point `DOCLING_ARTIFACTS_PATH` at a local cache directory.
3. Run conversions with hub offline mode enabled after prefetch
   (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`).

## Usage

```bash
vera convert "manual.pdf" "manual.vera" --parser docling
vera convert "memo.docx" "memo.vera" --parser docling
vera convert "notes.html" "notes.vera"
vera convert "manual.pdf" "manual.vera" --parser docling:hybrid
```

```python
from vera_ingest import convert

convert("manual.pdf", "manual.vera", parser="docling")
convert("memo.docx", "memo.vera", parser="docling")
convert("notes.html", "notes.vera")
```

The default Docling variant is `hybrid`. Unknown variants fail before parsing.

## Behavior

- Parses PDFs with Docling's `DocumentConverter` (tables and picture crops on).
  Cropped pictures are stored as figure attachments and linked onto a nearby
  same-page chunk. Docling's HybridChunker omits pictures from chunk text
  (empty image placeholder), so that linking is what makes `--figures` work.
- Also converts DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and HTML (including `.htm`) for search.
  Those types use Docling's SimplePipeline (no layout-model download, RapidOCR,
  or `pypdfium2` recovery). Citations are searchable; PDF-style page highlight
  overlays are not produced. Omit `--parser` to select Docling from the
  extension when this extra is installed; PDFs still default to PyMuPDF.
- Chunks with Docling `HybridChunker` and an explicit whitespace tokenizer so
  `chunk_size` maps to whitespace-split words without downloading a HuggingFace
  tokenizer.
- Owns typed defaults: `chunk_size=500` whitespace tokens, `ocr_mode=auto`,
  `ocr_language=en`, `pdf_backend=docling_parse`. Descriptor fields do **not**
  include `overlap` or `ocr_dpi`, so those legacy convert/CLI aliases are not
  forwarded. The Tesseract `--ocr-language` / `ocr_language` alias is also
  not forwarded (`capabilities.ocr_engine` is RapidOCR, not Tesseract).
- Stores readable chunk text for keyword search and contextualized text for
  embeddings.
- Maps provenance boxes from Docling bottom-left coordinates to VERA top-left
  page points.
- Attempts automatic recovery on **PDFs** when Docling returns page-level memory errors
  (`bad_alloc`) or the whole-document convert raises; rejects only when
  recovery is exhausted instead of publishing an incomplete archive. DOCX,
  PPTX, XLSX, and HTML skip this path.
- `ocr_language` expects a RapidOCR-native code (for example `en`, `fr`,
  `cyrillic`); it is **not** translated from Tesseract-style codes, so
  PyMuPDF's `eng` is not valid here. The shared `--ocr-language` CLI default
  (`eng`) is not forwarded to this pipeline; Docling keeps `en` unless you
  pass `--pipeline-option ocr_language=...`.
- Disables Docling's `torch.compile` path so Windows conversions do not require
  Visual Studio's `cl.exe`, and keeps Docling's default `images_scale`.

## Reliability on large/complex PDFs

Docling's default `docling_parse` backend can hit native `std::bad_alloc` on
some large or complex pages. VERA recovers automatically:

1. Convert the whole document with the selected `pdf_backend` (default
   `docling_parse`).
2. On `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` with page-attributable memory errors, retry each failed
   page with a **fresh** converter (`page_range=(n, n)`), still on
   `docling_parse`.
3. If a single-page retry still fails, retry that page once with `pypdfium2`.
4. If too many pages fail (more than 20% of the document) or `convert()` raises,
   reconvert the **whole** document once with `pypdfium2`.
5. If that whole-document convert raises or does not fully succeed, convert in
   page batches with `pypdfium2` (one reused converter) so peak memory stays
   bounded on large manuals.
6. If recovery still cannot produce a complete result, conversion fails with a
   message that includes the underlying exception. The sidecar also prints the
   traceback to stderr (`[vera-sidecar]` in `npm run app:dev`).

Force the low-memory backend for an entire conversion:

```bash
vera convert "manual.pdf" --parser docling --pipeline-option pdf_backend=pypdfium2
```

Successful recoveries are recorded in ingest diagnostics (the inspect JSON
`ocr` object — use `--json`; text-mode inspect omits it): `pdf_backend`,
`recovered_pages`, `recovered_pages_backend`, and optionally
`whole_document_fallback_backend` and `whole_document_fallback_strategy`
(`document` or `batched`). Field tables live under
[Inspect metadata](../validation-and-export.md#pipeline-diagnostics-ocr).
`pypdfium2` is faster and more memory-stable but can reduce table/layout
fidelity compared with `docling_parse`.

## Desktop app

The 0.3.0 desktop Convert view does not list Docling. Use this package from
the CLI (`vera convert --parser docling`, or omit `--parser` on DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/HTML)
after installing `vera-cli[docling]`.
Pipeline descriptors still omit overlap and OCR DPI when a future desktop
host lists the plugin.
