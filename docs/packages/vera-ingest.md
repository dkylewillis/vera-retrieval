# vera-ingest

`vera-ingest` publishes the `vera_ingest` Python package. It depends on
`vera-doc` and owns the ingest-pipeline registry, shared descriptors and
types, conversion orchestration, reusable chunking helpers, and
ingest-produced viewer helpers.

PDF parsing and OCR live in provider plugins that register through the
`vera.ingest_pipelines` entry-point group. The default
[`vera-ingest-pymupdf`](vera-ingest-pymupdf.md) package provides the `pymupdf`
pipeline; Markdown ingest ships inside `vera-ingest` as provider `markdown`;
[`vera-ingest-docling`](vera-ingest-docling.md) provides Docling's
hybrid chunker (PDF plus search-only DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/HTML). Extra plugins are pip packages in the same environment as
the CLI or desktop sidecar.

Pipelines return a normalized `IngestResult`. Shared `convert()` writes
validated archives through one atomic path and emits ready-made `ChunkRecord`
values plus optional attachments via `VeraDocument`. Viewer helpers under
`vera_ingest.viewer` read those ingest conventions back out for CLI, MCP, and
app consumers.

## Install

From PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install "vera-ingest>=0.3.0"
```

For PDF conversion, also install a pipeline plugin (`vera` and `vera-app`
depend on `vera-ingest-pymupdf` by default):

```bash
python -m pip install "vera-ingest-pymupdf>=0.3.0"
```

From a repository checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install ./packages/vera-doc ./packages/vera-ingest ./packages/vera-ingest-pymupdf
```

Python 3.10 or newer is required. Core `vera-ingest` does not pull in PyMuPDF
or pdfplumber; those arrive with the pipeline plugin.

## Start here

```python
from vera_ingest import convert

convert(
    "manual.pdf",
    "manual.vera",
    parser="pymupdf",
    pipeline_options={"ocr_mode": "auto"},
    model="hashing",
    store_original=True,
)

convert("notes.md", "notes.vera", model="hashing")
```

Pass `embedding_function=` for a custom embedder, or use a
`provider:model-id` model spec resolved by `vera_doc.get_embedder`. New callers
should pass `parser`, `pipeline_options`, and embedder settings
(`model` / `embedding_function` / `embedder_options`); legacy
kwargs such as `chunk_size` and `ocr_mode` remain compatibility aliases
forwarded only when explicitly provided. Omitted aliases mean the pipeline's
own default.

## Concepts

- **Pipeline registry** discovers installed providers via entry points
  (`vera.ingest_pipelines`) or in-process `register_ingest_pipeline()`.
  Specs resolve as `provider[:variant]` with no silent fallback. Broken
  entry points are logged and collected by `list_ingest_pipeline_load_errors()`
  instead of hiding other providers. Registry and
  descriptor APIs are experimental and may change before 1.0.
- **Pipeline-owned config** keeps typed defaults, validation, and field
  descriptors inside each ingest plugin; shared convert passes a thin
  `IngestRequest` with opaque `pipeline_options`.
- **Chunking helpers** remain available for providers that want sliding-window
  behavior (whitespace-split words, not characters) without owning the writer.
  First-party pipelines use `build_chunks_from_blocks` (or their own chunker).
  `chunk_pages` and `detect_heading` stay public for custom pipelines that
  only have page text. Parsers emit `ParsedBlock`; convert with
  `IngestBlock.from_parsed` before returning `IngestResult.blocks`.
- **Atomic conversion** validates a temporary archive before publishing it.
