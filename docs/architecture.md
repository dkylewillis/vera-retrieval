# VERA Architecture

## Package boundaries

VERA is a mono-repo of independently installable packages. Dependencies move
inward toward the storage and search engine:

```text
vera-ingest-pymupdf ─┐
vera-ingest-docling ─┤
vera-embed-openai ───┤
vera-ingest ─────────┼──> vera-doc
vera ────────────────┤
vera-app ────────────┤
vera-mcp ────────────┘
vera-lab (dev only) ─┘
```

No package may make `vera-doc` depend on extraction, a user interface, MCP,
evaluation tooling, or a source-file format. `vera-lab` is a contributor-only
leaf (workspace `dev` extra); it is not shipped in releases or the packaged
desktop sidecar.

### `vera-doc`

`vera-doc` publishes the `vera_doc` Python package. It is an embedded vector
database backed by one portable SQLite `.vera` file.

It owns:

- the current `.vera` schema and format validation;
- immutable `ChunkRecord`, `AttachmentRecord`, and query-result objects;
- transactional chunk and attachment CRUD;
- embedding generation and storage;
- keyword, semantic, and hybrid retrieval;
- corpus search and rebuildable `.vera-index/` library indexes.

It does not parse, clean, OCR, or chunk source content. It does not know what a
PDF is. Attachments are opaque bytes, and chunk/archive metadata is
JSON-compatible caller data. Format 0.1 is historical; `vera-doc` reads 0.2 archives only.

### `vera-ingest`

`vera-ingest` publishes `vera_ingest`. It owns the provider-neutral ingest
core:

- ingest-pipeline registry and descriptors;
- shared types (`IngestRequest` / `IngestResult`, pages/blocks);
- reusable chunking helpers (`build_chunks_from_blocks` for structured
  layout; `chunk_pages` / `detect_heading` for custom page-text pipelines);
- atomic single-file and batch conversion workflows;
- reader helpers for pages, figures, regions, and source export.

PDF parsing and OCR live in plugin packages that register through
`vera.ingest_pipelines`. It emits final `ChunkRecord` objects and writes them
through `VeraDocument`. `vera-doc` never imports `vera_ingest`. Plugins are
named after the parsing engine (`pymupdf`, `docling`), not the file type;
planned extra formats and Markdown grounding stay in ingest conventions
(see [Additional source formats and visual grounding](multi-format-ingest.md))
and do not change the 0.2 archive schema.

### `vera-ingest-pymupdf`

`vera-ingest-pymupdf` registers the default `pymupdf` pipeline:

- PDF parsing and table extraction (PyMuPDF + pdfplumber);
- selective OCR and bundled Tesseract English data;
- heading detection and sliding-window chunk construction (whitespace-split words);
- mapping pages, regions, figures, and provenance to chunk metadata.

`vera` and `vera-app` depend on it so conversion works out of the box.

### `vera-ingest-docling`

`vera-ingest-docling` is the official Docling pipeline that registers
`docling` / `docling:hybrid`. CLI users install it with
`pip install "vera[docling]>=0.3.0"` or `uv sync --extra docling`. The
0.3.x desktop app does not freeze or list it; Convert lists PyMuPDF and the
bundled Markdown pipeline. Extra
ingest plugins are ordinary pip packages in the same environment. See
[vera-ingest-docling](packages/vera-ingest-docling.md).

### `vera-embed-openai`

`vera-embed-openai` is the official OpenAI embeddings plugin. It registers
`openai` under `vera.embedders` with stdlib `urllib` (no OpenAI SDK).
`vera` and `vera-app` depend on it, and the packaged sidecar freezes it
beside PyMuPDF. Secrets stay in `OPENAI_API_KEY`. See
[vera-embed-openai](packages/vera-embed-openai.md).

### `vera`

`vera` publishes the `vera` console script and `vera_cli` module (source in
`packages/vera-cli`). It owns argument parsing, text/JSON formatting, exit
codes, and retrieval evaluation. Conversion commands compose `vera-ingest`
(+ pipeline plugins) with `vera-doc`. `vera-cli` remains a PyPI compatibility
alias.

### `vera-mcp`

`vera-mcp` publishes `vera_mcp` and the `vera-mcp` console script. It is a
thin MCP adapter over `vera-doc` search/storage APIs and `vera-ingest.viewer`
helpers. The optional `vera[mcp]` extra installs it for `vera mcp`.

### `vera-app`

`vera-app` owns the Electron/React desktop application, Python sidecar, LLM
providers, sessions, and application state. It depends on `vera-doc`,
`vera-ingest`, `vera-ingest-pymupdf`, and `vera-embed-openai`
(including
viewer helpers), not on the CLI package. Packaged conversions keep one frozen
sidecar for search, Ask, PyMuPDF, Markdown ingest, and OpenAI embeddings. MiniLM (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) runs on
ONNX Runtime; `npm run app:dev` vendors that graph before launch. When no
MiniLM ONNX graph is present, MiniLM falls back to Sentence Transformers
(`ml` extra), which is how CLI installs run it.
Extra ingest and embedding plugins are pip packages in that same environment.

### `vera-lab`

`vera-lab` is a contributor layout lab. It depends on `vera-ingest` and
PyMuPDF, runs a pipeline (or reads an archive) into a normalized view model,
and writes a self-contained HTML report with page overlays, lint, and stats.
Nothing in the release path depends on it. See
[vera-lab](packages/vera-lab.md).

## Core Python API

Applications that already have chunks need only `vera-doc`:

```python
from vera_doc import ChunkRecord, VeraDocument

with VeraDocument.create("knowledge.vera") as document:
    document.add(
        [
            ChunkRecord(
                id="requirements-1",
                text="The minimum pipe diameter is 12 inches.",
                metadata={"source": "manual.pdf", "page": 42},
            )
        ]
    )

with VeraDocument.open("knowledge.vera") as document:
    results = document.search(text="minimum pipe size", top_k=5)
```

The write API accepts only final chunks and optional opaque attachments:

```python
from vera_doc import AttachmentRecord, AttachmentRef, ChunkRecord

source = AttachmentRecord(
    id="source",
    media_type="application/pdf",
    filename="manual.pdf",
    data=pdf_bytes,
)
record = ChunkRecord(
    id="chunk-1",
    text="Ready-made chunk text.",
    attachments=(AttachmentRef("source", role="source"),),
)
```

Extraction is explicitly composed:

```python
from vera_ingest import convert

convert("manual.pdf", "manual.vera")
```

The root uv workspace links packages as editable dependencies. Published
packages use normal version constraints; source copying and Git submodules are
not dependency mechanisms.

## Format compatibility

New archives and conversions write VERA 0.2 only. The chunk-oriented current
format is documented in [vera-spec-v0.2.md](vera-spec-v0.2.md). The older
0.1 document/page/block schema remains in
[vera-spec-v0.1.md](vera-spec-v0.1.md) for historical reference. That schema is
deprecated and is no longer read by `vera-doc`.

## Repository strategy

Keep the packages in one GitHub repository while schema, extraction, CLI, and
desktop changes commonly need atomic integration work. Separate repositories
only when ownership, release cadence, governance, or deployment constraints
actually diverge. Before a split, publish versioned wheels and test dependents
against both minimum and latest supported package versions.
